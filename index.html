    <h3>New Moon</h3>
    This is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it’s also up during the day! Remember, in this phase, the Moon doesn’t usually pass directly between Earth and the Sun, due to the inclination of the Moon’s orbit. It only passes near the Sun from our perspective on Earth.
  </div>
  <div class="moon-phase-par">
    <h3>Waxing Crescent Phase</h3>
    The waxing crescent phase is the first visible stage of the moon's illumination following the new moon. A small, crescent-shaped portion of the moon becomes illuminated, growing larger each night as it progresses towards the first quarter phase. This phase is typically visible in the western sky shortly after sunset, marking the beginning of the moon's waxing or increasing illumination cycle. It symbolizes growth, expansion, and the start of new endeavors.
  </div>
  <div class="moon-phase-par">
    <h3>First Quarter Phase</h3>
    The first quarter phase occurs when the moon has completed about one-quarter of its orbit around Earth since the new moon. During this phase, half of the moon's surface is illuminated and visible from Earth. The first quarter moon rises around midday, reaches its highest point in the sky around sunset, and sets around midnight. This phase is a time of balance and decision-making, as it represents a midpoint between the new moon and the full moon.
  </div>
  <div class="moon-phase-par">
    <h3>Waxing Gibbous Phase</h3>
    The waxing gibbous phase follows the first quarter moon and precedes the full moon. During this phase, more than half but less than all of the moon's surface is illuminated, continuing to grow towards full illumination. The waxing gibbous moon rises during the afternoon and remains visible throughout much of the night. This phase is associated with perseverance, refinement, and preparation as the moon approaches its fullest brightness.
  </div>
  <div class="moon-phase-par">
    <h3>Full Moon</h3>
    The full moon phase occurs when the entire illuminated side of the moon is visible from Earth. It happens approximately two weeks after the new moon and marks the midpoint of the lunar cycle. The full moon rises as the sun sets and sets as the sun rises, staying visible all night. Symbolically, the full moon represents culmination, completion, and the peak of energy. It's a time for celebration, illumination, and heightened emotions.
  </div>
  <div class="moon-phase-par">
    <h3>Waning Gibbous Phase</h3>
    The waning gibbous phase follows the full moon and precedes the last quarter moon. During this phase, more than half but less than all of the moon's surface remains illuminated, gradually decreasing towards the last quarter phase. The waning gibbous moon rises later at night and is visible in the sky during the early morning hours. This phase encourages reflection, release, and letting go as the moon's brightness diminishes.
  </div>
  <div class="moon-phase-par">
    <h3>Last Quarter Phase</h3>
    The last quarter phase occurs approximately three weeks after the new moon and marks the final quarter of the lunar cycle. Half of the moon's surface is illuminated during this phase, but the illuminated portion gradually decreases until the new moon phase. The last quarter moon rises around midnight, reaches its highest point in the sky around sunrise, and sets around midday. This phase symbolizes introspection, reassessment, and preparation for the upcoming cycle.
  </div>
  <div class="moon-phase-par">
    <h3>Waning Crescent Phase</h3>
    The waning crescent phase is the last visible stage of the moon's illumination before the new moon. A small, crescent-shaped portion of the moon's surface remains illuminated but decreases each night as it approaches the new moon phase. The waning crescent moon is visible in the eastern sky before sunrise, gradually fading into the dawn. This phase encourages rest, release, and surrender as the lunar cycle comes to a close.
